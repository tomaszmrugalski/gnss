Gdzie browar? is Polish for "where's beer?". This is a demo Android app that will eventually 
have a database of convenience stores with their opening hours and a convenient navigation to 
get you to a store that's still open. It is expected to use some GNSS (Global Navigation System Services)
services.

This is a student project, so don't expect much.
